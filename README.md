A* Search Algorithm

In this search algorithm,a minimum path to the goal is determined by use of both heuristics(manhattan distances) and path cost.The grid used is simple but in the case of a complex grid,you would realize how efficient it is in path finding.A priority queue is used to make sure that only the promising nodes are considered.
